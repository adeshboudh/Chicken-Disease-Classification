    "## Pipeline Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "The project pipeline consists of the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion:** Downloads and prepares the chicken fecal image dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prepare Base Model:** Loads a pre-trained CNN model (VGG16) and adapts it for the classification task.  Parameters like `IMAGE_SIZE`, `INCLUDE_TOP`, `CLASSES`, `WEIGHTS`, and `LEARNING_RATE` are configurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training:** Trains the model using the ingested data and the prepared base model.  Parameters such as `EPOCHS`, `BATCH_SIZE`, and `AUGMENTATION` control the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation:** Evaluates the trained model's performance on a test set and generates metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, saved in `scores.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CI/CD Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The GitHub Actions workflow (`main.yaml`) automates the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Continuous Integration:**\n",
    "    * Lints the code.\n",
    "    * Runs unit tests (currently placeholder commands).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Continuous Delivery:**\n",
    "    * Builds a Docker image of the application.\n",
    "    * Pushes the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Continuous Deployment (Self-hosted Runner):**\n",
    "    * Pulls the latest Docker image from ECR.\n",
    "    * Runs the Docker image on a self-hosted runner, serving the model via port 8080.\n",
    "    * Cleans up old Docker images and containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the project locally, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the repository.\n",
    "2. Install the required dependencies.\n",
    "3. Run the DVC pipeline using `dvc repro`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The `params.yaml` file contains the hyperparameters used for training the model.  These can be adjusted to optimize performance.\n",
    "\n",
